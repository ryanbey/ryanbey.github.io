She isn't used to having snowy winters and doesn't know what to expect with winter approaching. She would like a quick website she can visit to check the weather every day before she walks to class that isn't cluttered with information she doesn't care about. She just wants a quick glance as she walks out the door. She doesn't care too much about the details about the weather. The simpler, the better.</p>

He likes to look into the finer details about the weather around his area. He has found himself visiting multiple different sites to get all the information he needs.

She looks outside and can't really tell if it's cold, or really cold. She walks back over to her charging phone and goes to her bookmarks and selects the link to mistweather.com. The first thing she sees on the page is the current temperature for her location, with an overview of how much warmer it's going to get in the next few hours. After a quick glance, Rachel realizes it's going to be a lot colder than she though, and goes back to her closet to grab a heavier coat.</p>
